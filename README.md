Crib is a house management app built by hackers, for hackers. Designed for shared hacker houses, Crib smooths out the chaos of eight people in a two-bedroom apartment. From voting on issues and sharing one-time secrets to sending affirmations and tracking chores — all with Discord integration — Crib brings it all together in one sleek, collaborative dashboard.

HackClub Neigherbpurhood app idea: Dormroom big brother helper. log complains with an upvote downvote system, a built in app to determine what time people are free, a link to share sensative info (1 time instant link), an affirmation system. An internal member vote system to determine leader (chess elo system based on voting)

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
